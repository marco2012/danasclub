description: "Structured optimization workflow for PageSpeed Insights and Lighthouse that improves Core Web Vitals without changing UI/UX."
---

## Overview

This skill gives an AI agent a strict, repeatable process for improving PageSpeed Insights and Lighthouse results without changing your visual design or removing product functionality. It is built for real-world optimization work: isolate bottlenecks, apply minimum-safe fixes, re-measure, and stop once gains flatten.

## Compatibility

### Native

- **Claude Code / Claude**: direct skill package support using `SKILL.md`.
- **Codex/OpenAI workflows**: compatible with Agent Skills-format content (`SKILL.md`) and can be used as reusable workflow instructions.

### Manual Adaptation

- **OpenClaw, Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini, and other IDE agents**: use the same `SKILL.md` content as a workflow template or prompt file if native skill import is unavailable.

## Prerequisites

- A route to test (production, staging, or preview URL)
- Baseline Lighthouse/PageSpeed run for **mobile and desktop**
- Ability to run project checks after edits (`type-check`, `build`, smoke tests)
- Access to deploy and re-test

## What This Skill Optimizes

- LCP diagnosis and render delay reduction
- Render-blocking CSS/JS mitigation
- Unused JavaScript/CSS reduction
- Third-party script scheduling strategy
- Cache policy and static asset delivery consistency
- Regression-safe micro-optimizations for initial route payload

## How to Use This Skill

### Prompt Pattern

Use this prompt:

```text
Apply the PageSpeed Insights optimizer skill to <route>.
Constraints:
1) No UI/UX redesign or feature removal.
2) Preserve accessibility and SEO behavior.
3) Prioritize highest-impact, lowest-risk fixes first.
Deliverables:
- Baseline metrics table (mobile + desktop)
- Ranked bottlenecks and root causes
- Minimal patch plan
- Post-change metrics with deltas
```

### Execution Flow

1. Capture baseline metrics and record exact failing audits.
2. Identify the current LCP element and why it is delayed.
3. Apply smallest change set that targets top bottlenecks only.
4. Re-run benchmarks and compare deltas.
5. If gains are below threshold, stop and report diminishing returns.

## Optimization Playbook

### 1) LCP and above-the-fold path

- Reduce server and render delay for the LCP element.
- Ensure critical route data and styles load predictably.
- Move non-critical work after first render.

### 2) Render-blocking resources

- Keep critical CSS minimal.
- Defer non-critical scripts and low-priority widgets.
- Avoid introducing blocking dependencies in root layout.

### 3) Bundle pressure

- Defer or split route-noncritical bundles.
- Remove or gate dead/unused client-side modules.
- Keep initial route payload focused on first-screen needs.

### 4) Third-party impact

- Delay analytics and low-priority scripts.
- Verify no third-party library blocks first paint.
- Keep third-party bytes and main-thread work accountable.

### 5) Cache + delivery checks

- Ensure static assets use long-lived immutable caching where safe.
- Ensure API and dynamic routes are not accidentally over-cached.
- Validate cache behavior after deploy.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Score regresses after adding "helpful" scripts  
**Fix:** Prioritize first-view rendering; move non-critical scripts to idle/lazy load.

**Issue:** LCP remains high despite JS reductions  
**Fix:** Re-check the actual LCP element, image/font loading path, and render delay.

**Issue:** Mobile score volatile between runs  
**Fix:** Use median over multiple runs and compare stable deltas, not single spikes.

**Issue:** Good lab scores but poor field data  
**Fix:** Track CrUX trends and verify real-user bottlenecks (device/network mix, third-party load).

## Notes for This Repository

- Use the generated index and existing scripts (`pnpm type-check`, `pnpm build`) after each optimization patch.
- Keep changes scoped to measurable performance deltas.
- Preserve the current visual layout and interaction model.
